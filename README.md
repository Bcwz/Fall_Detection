## Training Code
"keras-train.py" is the code used to train the model, to be used on a PC.
"dataset.csv" is the dataset we have used to train the model.

## Models Trained
"testmodel-new-C-24x24" is the model we will be using for our project.
The other models, "testmodel-new-C-12", "testmodel-new-C-12x12" and "testmodel-new-C-24", were used for comparison testing, and not used in the final version.
